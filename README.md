Youtube downloads by ID.
Spotify downloads by "Artist - Song Name" in a youtube search extracted by metadata from Spotify Web Api.
Soundcloud hasnt been worked on.

A known issue is sometimes spotify wont extract an author of a song and the whole things freezes.
I know the Discord button dosent work because my last Discord account got banned for doing something like this.
Also the exit button needs to be clicked twice to actually fade out and exit, idk why.

Anime girls on the homepage is Ryuko (Kill la Kill), Akeno (Highschool DxD), Tohka (Date a Live).
All three are my top personal favorites and I had nothing else to add on the homepage.
